# 🛠️ Lathe Carriage, Guideways & Lead Screw Structural Design and Simulation
---

## 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on the **design, structural analysis, and simulation of a manual lathe machine’s carriage, guideways, and lead screw system** — core components responsible for precise tool positioning during machining.  

Our goal was to understand how these elements behave under actual machining forces (cutting forces, weight, reaction moments) and ensure that they meet safety and functional standards through both analytical and simulation-based validations.

This included:
- Deriving load equilibrium conditions  
- Calculating contact and axial forces  
- Assessing stress concentration at guideway junctions  
- Designing a lead screw resistant to both torsional and buckling failure  
- Validating the entire system using SolidWorks static and buckling simulations  
- Cross-verifying calculations with custom MATLAB scripts

## 📐 Why This Matters

In any lathe machine, ensuring the **carriage and lead screw assembly can withstand cutting loads without excessive deformation or buckling is essential** for precision and operator safety. 

This project replicates real-world design decision-making — combining material selection, dimensioning, stress analysis, and simulation — reflecting practical mechanical engineering challenges.
