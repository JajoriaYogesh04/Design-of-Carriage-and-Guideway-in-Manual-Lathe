# 🛠️ Lathe Machine Design Project

This project focuses on the **design and modeling of a manual lathe machine**, including key components like the **carriage**, **bed**, **headstock**, **tailstock**, and cutting tool assembly. The primary goal is to understand functional requirements and determine general dimensions suitable for small to medium-sized lathes.

## 📐 Project Overview

The manual lathe is one of the most fundamental machine tools used in workshops for:
- Turning
- Facing
- Threading
- Drilling
- Parting
- Knurling

This project includes:
- Component-wise dimension study
- 3D CAD design of the lathe assembly
- Tool-workpiece interaction analysis
- Reference dimension collection

---

## 📏 Key Design Focus: Carriage

The **carriage** supports and moves the cutting tool. It includes:
- Saddle
- Cross slide
- Compound rest
- Tool post

### General Carriage Dimensions:
| Parameter | Range |
|----------|--------|
| Length   | 300 – 700 mm |
| Width    | 150 – 300 mm |
| Height   | 100 – 250 mm |

> Dimensions vary based on overall lathe size and bed width.

### Tool Cutting Point Alignment:
- The cutting tool should be aligned with the **spindle centerline**.
- Distance between tool center and actual cutting point should ideally be **0 mm**, with an allowable error of ±0.1 mm.

## 🔩 Other Major Components

- **Headstock**: Contains motor and spindle
- **Tailstock**: Used for support and drilling
- **Bed**: Foundation of the lathe
- **Chuck**: Holds the rotating workpiece
